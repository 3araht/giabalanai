giabalanai keyboard is a simple-design Chromatic Button Accordion-ish MIDI keyboard (60 bass + C-system 62 keys = 38 notes) which doesn't have bellows nor register switches.
A rotary encoder can be used for adjusting system volume of your computer (PC / Mac / iPad).

It works on iPad as well, tested with the below adapter used with a power supply. The power supply is necessary to use giabalanai on iPad. Make sure to use "Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adapter", not "Lightning to USB Camera Adapter".

# How it looks & how it works
Check these short videos ([video1](https://github.com/3araht/giabalanai/blob/master/videos/giabalanai_keyboard.mp4), [video2](https://github.com/3araht/giabalanai/blob/master/videos/62buttons_38notes.mp4)) to see what it's like.

Here's another [video](https://github.com/3araht/giabalanai/blob/master/videos/giabala_dangi_ep.16_theme_song_feat.Mr.Seto.mp4), trying to play (pardon my poor playing skills) a theme song of Giabala-Dangi (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSVRJk6kDiM).

## Miscellaneous
#### Origin of the name: giabalanai
When you pronounce giabalanai, it sounds like "蛇腹無い" in Japanese = *bellows-less*, which represents the keyboard.

Well, the ancestor of this keyboard is located in Italy ;-) so an Italian spelling method is used.
That's why it is not *jabaranai* but giabalanai.
<!--- not jabaranai but giabalanai ジャバラナイの名前の由来 -->
